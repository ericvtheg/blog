## The Problem

When you're building a product solo, the actual coding is the easy part. The hard part is deciding what to build.

Do I add the feature users keep asking for? Fix that nagging bug? Optimize the landing page? Write content for SEO? Every decision has tradeoffs and there's no PM to help prioritize.

I end up spending way more time in analysis paralysis than I do writing code. This needed to change.

## What I Built

I created a Claude Code plugin called [Solo Founder Toolkit](https://github.com/ericvtheg/solo-founder-toolkit) that extends Claude with commands and skills built specifically for indie hackers.

Instead of generic AI responses, it gives opinionated frameworks for making these decisions faster.

### Feature Prioritization

The `/solo-feature-ideas` command analyzes your codebase and suggests next features based on what would have the most impact. It considers your existing architecture and what users are likely to need.

### Build in Public Content

Run `/solo-build-in-public-tweet` and it takes your recent git commits and generates tweet ideas. Helps you talk about what you're building without spending an hour crafting posts.

### Landing Page Optimization

Ask Claude to "review my landing page" and it gives CRO feedback using the same frameworks that conversion consultants use. No hiring someone or reading a dozen blog posts.

### Decision Frameworks

When you're stuck between options, Claude walks you through prioritization frameworks like RICE scoring or ICE. Stops you from going in circles and helps you just make a decision and move forward.

## Implementation

The plugin uses Claude Code's custom slash commands and skills system. Commands are markdown files that extend Claude's behavior for specific tasks.

Here's the structure:

```
plugins/solo-founder-toolkit/
├── commands/           # Slash commands like /solo-feature-ideas
├── skills/             # Longer-form guidance (landing page review, etc)
└── .mcp.json          # Plugin configuration
```

Each command is just a markdown file with a detailed prompt. For example, the feature prioritization command:

- Analyzes the codebase structure using Glob and Grep
- Identifies common patterns and existing features
- Suggests next steps based on impact vs effort
- Returns prioritized list with reasoning

The skills work similarly but are designed for interactive workflows where Claude needs to ask follow-up questions.

## Why This Works

Most AI coding tools are built for teams or generic tasks. This is opinionated about the solo founder workflow:

- Ship fast over perfect
- Revenue over vanity metrics
- Good enough today over perfect next month

When you're building alone you can't afford to spend weeks building the wrong thing. You need frameworks to decide quickly and iterate.

## Installation

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ericvtheg/solo-founder-toolkit.git
```

Then follow Claude Code's plugin installation docs to add it to your setup.

Once installed, try `/solo-feature-ideas` or ask Claude to "help me prioritize what to build next."

## What's Next

I'm planning to automate more of the repetitive processes solo founders deal with - deployment decisions, user feedback analysis, metric tracking, etc.

If you're a solo founder and want to contribute, I'd welcome it. There's a lot of common workflows we all share that could be codified into reusable commands. You can [open an issue](https://github.com/ericvtheg/solo-founder-toolkit/issues) or submit a PR with workflows that have worked for you.
