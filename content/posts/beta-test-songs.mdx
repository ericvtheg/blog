## What is [BetaTestSongs.com](https://BetaTestSongs.com)

(Hopefully that link isn't dead)

BetaTestSongs.com is meant for EDM producers. It's a tool to help solve the problem of getting unbiased feedback for WIP (work in progress) tracks.
It does this by creating a marketplace where producers can anonymously submit and review tracks.

## Objective

Create something with as little work as possible that still helps people. I.e. I want to build an MVP (minimum viable product).

I definitely failed to do as little work as possible. Through the course of this project I caught myself over engineering things left and right. I will go into this later in the article.

### Things That Reduced Time and Development Effort

- Used [a template](https://tailwindui.com/components/marketing/sections/heroes) and [React components](https://tailwindui.com/components/application-ui/overlays/modals) from Tailwind CSS.
  - Using a template and ready made React components helps so much with not messing around with design and responsiveness.
- Opted out of user authentication.
  - By avoiding authentication I'm not only getting rid of an extra hurdle for users, I'm also saving myself the complexity that comes with it.
- Deployed directly from my machine (as opposed to using GitHub Actions).
  - This was the first time I did this. Instead of building out Github Actions and managing secrets, I just ran deployments directly from my machine.
- Opted to use links instead of files.
  - Instead of managing file uploads, storage, and fetching, users just submitted [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com) links to their tracks.

## Core Functionality

### Domain Concepts

Song: a song that an artist wants feedback for.

Review: feedback given to a song.

Review Queue: a FIFO queue of songs waiting to be approved.

Review Started: a user has started a review and now "owns" that song for an hour. If the review is not completed it goes back to the review queue with top priority.

Review Finished: feedback has been submitted.

### Access Patterns

Users can:

- submit a link to a song
- start a review, which will fetch the oldest song in the review queue
- submit a review, which will trigger a notification email to the user that requested the review
- see a submitted review for a song

## Architecture

The web app is hosted with AWS using the following services: s3, CloudFront, ECS, EC2, ECR, RDS, & SES.

Here is a high level diagram of the cloud infrastructure that makes up BetaTestSongs.com.

<div
  style={{
    width: "660px",
    height: "340px",
    margin: "10px",
    position: "relative",
  }}
>
  <iframe
    allowfullscreen
    frameborder="0"
    style={{ width: "660px", height: "340px", "pointer-events": "none" }}
    src="https://lucid.app/documents/embedded/53942ca1-d74d-4190-a7e0-5b6f009ea749"
    id="TdCcGj3-CkVz"
  ></iframe>
</div>

Naturally as a web app, there are two distinct parts: the backend and frontend.

### Frontend Tech

- Vite
- React
- Tailwind CSS

### Backend Tech

- Containers
- NestJS
- Postgres
- Mixpanel (analytics)
