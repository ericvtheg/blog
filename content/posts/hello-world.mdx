## What?

About software.

## Why?

I believe writing is an underappreciated skill in the engineering industry.

I would like to improve my writing to be better equipped for doing things such as writing tickets, documentation, and communicating with colleagues.

Lastly writing helps with a cluttered mind. I believe by writing I will be left with a better understanding of topics I have learned.

## When?

Right now baby.

## How?

For this project I am using Next.js hosted by Vercel, because it's quick and easy. Here you can find the [github repo](https://github.com/ericvtheg/blog) and the [Next.js template](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/nextjs-contentlayer).

The template included all the tech I wanted:

- SSR framework (since content is static)
- Contentlayer (Headless CMS)
- Tailwind (❤️)
- Typescript

## Who?

You can check out the [about page](/about) to get to know a bit more about me.
