# Introduction

My former highschool college counselor, Nicole Dorfler, invited me to give a presentation 
about software engineering for Career Day at my former highschool. I was ecstatic to have 
the opportunity to do so. 

The prompt I was given for Career Day was:
>We would like you to chat with our students about your college major selection, career path that led to your current occupation, and what you do on a day-to-day basis at your job.

In this blog post I'm going to recap some key details of the presentation.

Before I do that, I'd like to preface with: seeing the High Tech Los Angeles staff 
was a delightful experience. It is abundantly clear how much the staff truly cares for their students.
Both current and former. I'd also like to mention that my high school helped make me 
the person I am today. And I have the HTLA staff to thank for that. I also must thank 
the students for being attentive, showing genuine interest, and asking thoughtful questions. 
It also made me very happy to have students stay after the presentation to get further guidance 
on their path of software engineering. It was incredibly fulfilling to go back to my highschool,
8 years after I graduated, to give a presentation of my career. It was truly a full circle moment. 


# The Presentation

With that said let's get into it. The presentation format was 20 minutes and done 
4 separate times for 4 separate groups of students.

I had a lot of enthusiasm pent up for this, and I wanted to make sure to do my part of making the career
path of software engineering an intriguing choice for students. After all, I truly love what I do. 
Although I did have to contain my enthusiasm, in my first practice run of 12 slides I presented them 
in 5 minutes. It was clearly information overload. I also had to make sure to take a step back, 
and communicate in a way that wasn't purely technical. I had to keep in mind the perspective of a 
highschool student. 

## What Is Coding?

Naturally I gave a brief introduction to what coding is and what you can accomplish with it.
From my perspective, coding is the ability to tell a computer what to do via instructions. 
The truly magical part is you only have to build something once, and from there it's 
infinitely scalable. Meaning with my finger tips I can build something that the entire world could use. 

## Extracurricular Activities Do Not Have to Be Formal

HTLA is a small highschool. I had a graduating class of about ~80 students. With that comes less 
options for sports and extracurricular activities. Naturally that can be discouraging to not have 
many choices that you click with. So a point I wanted to emphasize was anything you do outside of a 
classroom is an extracurricular activity. It all depends on how you frame it. 

An example I gave of an activity I did outside of school was my competitive gaming days. 
I played competitive Team Fortress 2 in highschool, where I assumed 
a leadership role. I would schedule scrimmages with other teams; coordinating a time and place 
for 18 people to play. I also organized meetings to prepare for matches and even held 
retroactives of matches/practices where we would critique our play and grow as a team. 
In the end our team came in first place in our division of about ~1000 people. Even if this 
extracurricular at the time was a bit deviated from the norm, I do believe it shows passion and 
demonstrable leadership skills. 

Unfortunately in my head as a high schooler, this wasn't extracurricular at all. 
It was just a video game. Resulting in me completely leaving it out of my college applications. 

I wanted to make sure to give the highschool students the perspective that anything you do outside of a 
classroom is an extracurricular activity. Formal or not.

## Getting Started as a Software Engineer

I wanted to make sure to give the students some next steps if they did find some interest
in software engineering. I pointed them to `r/learnprogramming` and ChatGPT. I can see 
ChatGPT being a controversial resource for people learning to program, but I think as long 
as students are aware of the potential for mistakes (just like anyone else can make) the ability 
to have an immediate question and answer resource is invaluable. I can't even imagine being able to 
start my programming journey with a 1:1 tutor that will explain every line of code for me. 

I also gave what I believe is the best advice for anyone interested in coding. Try to build an idea 
that you're interested in. Me being a bit entrepreneurial and interested in solving people's problems has 
caused me to spend 1000s of hours on personal projects.

## Impostor Syndrome Is Real

I remember when I was attempting to program in highschool, everything just felt out of reach. Code just 
wouldn't click and didn't make sense for me. It caused me to second guess myself a lot. I wanted to 
emphasize to students that this is completely normal. That you will feel overwhelmed learning 
new technology because there is so much to grasp. It will take time and be frustrating. 
Knowing that impostor syndrome is normal in the industry I think helps a lot with the discouraging thoughts. 

## Building Stuff Is So Freaking Cool

To me the idea of software that I built being used by other people still hypes me up. 
It's what got me into the field and what keeps me here. There is nothing I enjoy more than 
making somebody's life slightly better through something I built. 

This is a point I wanted to really emphasize. The whole field of software engineering is about building 
stuff that other people use. If building stuff for others is enjoyable, then it may be a great fit 
as a career path. 

# Conclusion

In this presentation I aimed to give a broad overview of software engineering as a career and 
provide some short and long term guidance.

It was a privilege to present to the students that are currently in the very same position 
I was just a little less than a decade ago. It really meant a lot to me, and I hope 
that I positively impacted one of their lives even just a little bit. 

Cheers.
