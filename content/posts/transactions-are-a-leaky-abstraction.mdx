As application developers, database transactions abstract us away from
[concurrency control](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/concurrency-control-in-dbms/#)
to let us design our systems as if only a single process is modifying state serially. [1]
Unfortunately it isn't that simple.

## Transactions & Concurrency Control

Database transactions provide us the illusion that all operations are done serially.
If this were the case, we wouldn't need to concern ourselves with
situations where our data could be modified in unusual ways.

This illusion is created through concurrency control via transaction isolation.
Transactions can be configured using different levels of isolation.
Each level has potentially detrimental 'gotchas' that we must be aware of.
To create robust systems, it's essential to understand how transactions function
and the isolation level used by our database.

## Transaction Isolation Levels

Transaction isolation refers to how the database itself handles concurrent data access.
Each isolation level has its own rules for when data can be read/written to.
Limiting access to other transactions is done through locking and serialization.
As data access becomes more strict there are trade-offs such as stronger
data consistency but with worse performance. [1]

Understanding how our databases writes and reads is crucial for mitigating the potential
of race conditions between our concurrent transactions. To add even more complexity, there
is no standard for isolation levels across databases. For example, snapshot isolation in
PostgreSQL is called repeatable read, while in Oracle it is called serializable. [2]

Before diving into different transaction isolation levels, let's further discuss
what we are trying to avoid.

## Race Conditions

Race conditions can occur when multiple processes attempt to read/modify data at the same time—
leading to situations where unexpected outcomes occur.

An example of a race condition can be as benign as a user creating an account
but not yet seeing their profile when they refresh the page.
[A race condition can also be as sinister as bankrupting a CryptoConcurrency exchange](https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1wtbiu/how_i_stole_roughly_100_btc_from_an_exchange_and/).

Race conditions are tricky to test for because they only occur when we get unlucky with timing. [1]
To understand the depth of what in our software stack can be 'unlucky,' we must recognize
that anomalies can occur anywhere. They can occur in the application code at the top of the
stack and even in the firmware at the very bottom. For the purpose of this article we will focus on race conditions
that can occur in our database and how we can mitigate them using different transaction isolation levels.

### Mitigating Race Conditions

In this section we will go through race condition examples and discuss how they could be avoided
with different transaction isolation levels.

### Read Committed

The most basic level of transaction isolation is read committed. It makes two guarantees: [3]

> 1. When reading from the database, you will only see data that has been committed
> 2. When writing to the database, you will overwrite data that has been committed

<cite>&mdash; Martin Kleppmann</cite>

#### Race Condition Example

The race conditions prevented by the read committed isolation level are fundamental to database integrity.
An example of using repeatable read to avoid a race condition is maintaining state between multiple rows
within a schema.

For this example a user has bank accounts X and Y. They decide to transfer $10,000 from X and deposit into Y.
Since this entails two separate operations, this would require a database transaction
to ensure integrity in the operation. The result of the transaction should not be exposed
until it is fully completed. If this wasn't the case imagine that $10,000 was the total amount of money
the user had between bank accounts X and Y, in the middle of this operation executing the user refreshes the page.
Thus causing the user to see $0 in both bank accounts, a very uncomfortable situation for the user to be in.
Thankfully this typically would be solved shortly by another refresh.

Another case within this example could be the bank is determining the user's monthly fees for their bank
account. The bank has a policy where if the total dollars exceeds $5,000 then there is no
monthly bill. Unfortunately due to the lack of a transaction, the monthly billing service read $0 in
both accounts, causing a charge. A direct consequence of the race condition with real world consequences
that can be avoided using read committed.

### Snapshot Isolation and Repeatable Read

In the snapshot isolation transaction level, all transactions work on a snapshot
of the database from when the transaction began to when it ends. If subsequent transactions commit changes
during the duration of the original transaction, those changes will not be observed by the original transaction.
Overall the state of the database will remain the same from the perspective of the transaction for the
entirety of its execution. [4]

Snapshot isolation is used in PostgreSQL and MySQL and is referred to as repeatable read. [2]

#### Race Condition Example - Read Skew

An excellent example of a race condition that can be avoided through the use of snapshot isolation is when
creating a database backup. Naturally, when creating a backup of potentially several terabytes of data,
it will take a relatively long amount of time to complete. As the backup process is executing,
several other transactions can complete, potentially exposing us to inconsistencies in our data. [5]

For example, there is a backup is occurring and a user's bank account X is written to the backup with
$500. As the backup continues executing there is a transfer from bank account Y,
where $100 is sent to bank account X. If bank account Y has not yet been backed up,
there will be an inconsistency in the backup data where $100 magically went missing.
This inconsistency example is called read skew. [5] This case is averted by the backup processing using snapshot isolation.
By using snapshot isolation the data will remain in a consistent state, allowing us to create a reliable database backup.

### Serializable Isolation

We started this article saying that transaction isolation is a means to prevent data abnormalities
from occurring when there is concurrent data being read/written. What if we still could handle
concurrent reads/writes but the end result of the data appears as if the transactions had executed one at a time.
This level of transaction isolation is known as serialization. [6]

There are different ways to implement serialization, either by literally executing a transaction at a time
(often with partitioned data) or with extensive locking.

It is worth noting that the tradeoffs for serialization are significant. While
data integrity is guaranteed, there is a lack of scaling and the potential for much
higher read/write times. [7] [8]

#### Race Condition Example - Write Skew

Write skew is an easy to miss example of a race condition. Write skew is caused by phantoms, in other words,
data that does not exist. Write skew occurs when database operations depend on the absence of data.
The previous isolation levels mentioned, do nothing to create locks on data that does not yet exist.

Here is a real life example of write skew. I go to a fitness studio with live classes called Orange Theory
(not affiliated but I am a fan). I attend Orange Theory classes by going into the app
and booking a class. Naturally, a class has a finite amount of capacity that
can not be exceeded, so when scheduling a class for myself the database insert probably
looks something like:

```sql
INSERT Eric INTO SCHEDULED_ATTENDEES
WHERE SCHEDULED_ATTENDEES.class_id = X
AND 20 > (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM SCHEDULED_ATTENDEES WHERE class_id = X)
```

As you can see, we're checking that there are less than 20 attendees scheduled for class X.
If there are less than 20 rows for the class, then the database does the insert.
In other words we're checking for the absence of rows.

What happens if we only have a single slot left for a class, and two users request to book at
the same time? At the time of each request's database query there is less than 20 users
booked, so the database does the insert and the request is successful. Now, we have 21 users booked
for a class that only has the capacity for 20 people. A major error. In the previous transaction
isolation levels, there is no serialization and no locking on the non-existent rows.
Everything that took place was legal and the database schema itself
has no constraint on the amount of scheduled attendees for the class.

This is a sneaky race condition, but the serialization isolation level solves this right? For most implementations, no.
Serialization typically only locks rows that are being written to. Meaning that this case would still
occur, because the row being written does not prevent another row from being written

So how do we solve this? There are two ways:

1. By literally executing each transaction one at a time [6]
2. Using predicate locks [8]

Predicate locks work by locking a range of rows that the query accesses, whether they exist or not. [8]
By issuing a lock on the range of rows in this case, we prevent the race condition thus allowing us to safely book
our live fitness studio class. Phew.

## Conclusion

In this article we discussed different transaction isolation levels and what their
intentions are. So, which isolation level should we use for our applications?
Ultimately, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. The best we can do is choose the most
suitable isolation level for the job and work around its shortcomings in our application.
In order to do so we must have an understanding of how transactions work in our database.
The very definition of a leaky abstraction.
