First there was a CLI to interact with the computer, then a user interface, and now a CLI.
Except now we can communicate with the computer in just plain English.

# Introduction

We've seen the rise of LLMs and the hype surrounding them. They do awesome things
and are incredible at producing articulate natural language. Which is all well and good, but
how can we as software developers empower our applications with LLMs?

In order to do so we can use a technique known as _Retrieval Augmented Generation_ (RAG). In this
article we will create an example implementation of RAG.

# Implementation

The tool we're creating in this article is a Job Search Assistant. Given a description of
what a user is looking for, it will return a natural language response of related available
job listings. We will be using [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) to help us accomplish this.

Our Job Search Assistant will be backed by an example dataset from my friend's start up
[SurelyWork.com](https://SurelyWork.com). A startup focused on creating a specialized job board for creatives.

## Data Storage and Retrieval

Here we will talk about how we store our data and how we retrieve it in order to augment our prompt.

### Documents

Documents are used to represent data and will be stored in our vector database.
They can be queried for similarities based on a natural language string input.
The vector database checks the string for similarities with the `pageContent` field value in the document.
When a document is similar enough that it is returned, it includes both the `pageContent` and the `metadata` fields. The
`metadata` field is NOT for searching for similarities.

The LangChain interface for a document:

```ts
interface Document {
  pageContent: string;
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
}
```

There are different systems for splitting data into documents. In our case for Surely Work,
it is intuitively one document per job listing.

### Embeddings

[Embedding](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings) is the step where we translate our human readable data into an n dimensional vector.
The vectors, in our case, are specifically used for measuring relatedness.

In order to get the vectors from our data, we must use a machine learning model. We will be using OpenAI's
`text-embedding-ada-002` model to generate our embeddings.

### Vector Databases

Now that we know what embeddings are used for and where they come from (kinda),
we have to store them. By storing them in our vector database, we enable the ability to
search for related documents using a natural language string.

Generating our embeddings and loading them into a vector database using LangChain is as simple as:

```ts
// generate embeddings using OpenAI and store them into an in memory vector database
const vectorStore = await MemoryVectorStore.fromDocuments(
  documentData,
  new OpenAIEmbeddings()
);

// using a query string, fetch 1 document that is the most similar
const documentResult = await vectorStore.similaritySearch(query, 1);
```

Sweet, so now in the context of our Job Search Assistant we are able to quickly
fetch related job listings from a user's input. In the next section we will
utilize this functionality within our prompt to the LLM.

## Prompt Engineering

Using our ability to quickly fetch related job listings from a user's input, we can
augment our prompt to include the data. Our LLM will then smartly
use that data to answer our user's query.

### Example

Let's see an example of what an interaction with our Job Search Assistant would look like for a fashion designer seeking a job.

> **Input**: I'm a fashion designer based in Los Angeles.
>
> **Output**:
> That's great to hear! As a fashion designer based in Los Angeles, you might be interested in a couple of job listings we have on SurelyWork.com:
>
> 1. LA Fashion Week: Designer Casting Call by Asal Etemadi: They are looking for independent designers to showcase their work on their runway during LA Fashion Week. It's a great opportunity to have your designs come to life alongside mesmerizing music performances. The deadline to submit your designs is September 23rd. You can find more information and apply [here](https://www.surelywork.com/listings/2cWnvuxmo4eBAwxSyktC).
>
> 2. Casting Call for Jewelry Brand by Jacqueline Kulla: They are specifically looking to cast redheads for a shoot for their jewelry brand. If you have red hair, this could be a great opportunity for you. The details and application can be found [here](https://www.surelywork.com/listings/XaLMQl5uSWiuwDjBXBGk).
>
> Feel free to check out these listings and apply if they align with your interests and skills. Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with!

As you can see our LLM successfully used the data for the relevant job listings in its response and even included links to them.

### Dissecting the Prompt

Lets break our prompt into multiple parts to better understand what we are conveying to our LLM. Our prompt tells the LLM what
its purpose is, what data is to be included in the prompt, and how to use the data.

What it's purpose is:

```
You are Surely AI.
A chat bot for SurelyWork.com that helps people find applicable jobs as Creatives.
```

What data is included:

```
You should be given relevant job listings in the form of a JSON.
Following the job listings you will be given a prompt from a user.
```

How to use the data:

```
If you receive a job listing in the prompt include information about it in your response.
Feel free to not include some of the listings provided if you think they are not relevant.
If more than one of the job listings provided is relevant include information about all of them.
For every relevant job listing make sure to include the applicationUrl.
If none of the job listings are relevant, truthfully respond we don't have any relevant job listings at the moment.
You are strictly to talk about SurelyWork and its job listings, do not talk about anything else.
```

The data included:

```
Job Listings: <jobs_listings>

<human_prompt>
```

We convey our intent to the LLM and help guide its output to fit our needs. From there
the LLM does the rest of the magic of communicating in natural language seamlessly.

# Conclusion

With this article we were able to showcase an example of how LLMs give the
illusion that they are consulting with a database while "thinking".
When really we are just injecting data into the prompt to give that impression,
then the LLM itself just does its magic of seamless natural language processing.
