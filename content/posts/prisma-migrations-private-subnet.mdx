title: Running Prisma Migrations in a Private Subnet

## The Problem

Most of us who have had a hobby project using Prisma love the developer experience of generated types and easy schema migrations.
Eventually we get to the point where we need to actually deploy and host our code so users can interact with our software (that is the goal after all).
This requires us to do schema updates and migrations in our production environment without downtime.

As good software engineers, we know to keep our database safe from the outside world via private subnets.
In order to do so we must deal with the problem of running our Prisma migrations within the private subnet as well.

## Priorities

Now this problem for me typically comes up on my personal projects, because I don't have platform engineers working on making my life easier.
This means my priorities are: **low cost**, **automatic**, and **low complexity**.

## Architecture

In my backend architecture, I typically have the following setup:

<div
  style={{
    width: "660px",
    height: "340px",
    margin: "10px",
    position: "relative",
  }}
>
  <iframe
    allowfullscreen
    frameborder="0"
    style={{ width: "660px", height: "340px", "pointer-events": "none" }}
    src="https://lucid.app/documents/embedded/53942ca1-d74d-4190-a7e0-5b6f009ea749"
    id="TdCcGj3-CkVz"
  ></iframe>
</div>

Naturally, my application containers are running in the same private subnet as my database since they need access to the data.
Since we already have application code with all of the necessary secrets and accessibility to the database, seems like a natural place to run a migration!

## Implementation

We've established that our application containers can run the migration without any complicated build steps in our deployment pipeline.
The way we can do this is by making our `Prisma` module a prod dependency (i.e. not a dev dependency) and running `prisma migrate deploy` right before our application boots.

Take a look at my package.json file:

```
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "start:prod": "npm run prisma:migrate && node dist/src/main", // run migration before starting application
    "prisma:migrate": "prisma migrate deploy",
  },
  "dependencies": {
    ...
    "@prisma/client": "4.14.1",
    "prisma": "^4.14.1", // prod dependency
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```

We need the `prisma` module as a production dependency because it is running the migration in our deployed application container.
Now our prisma migrate runs right before our application starts and that's it.

Prisma maintains its own state of what migrations have and haven't been ran, so there is no issue with attempting to run the same migration over and over.

## Pros & Cons

The Pros are the same as our priorities: low cost, automatic, low complexity.

The cons are: inflated bundle size (Prisma is ~13 MB at the time of writing this) and potentially running multiple migrations at once.
The most concerning aspect is the latter. I have not encountered any issues so far, but with a big enough project and a good amount of bad luck who knows what could happen (we're talking about distributed systems after all).
The optimist in me says that between the database and Prisma this should be a case that is handled under the hood.

After doing some research, it seems like this used to be an [issue](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/discussions/3759),
but has been resolved ever since migrations were marked no longer "experimental." ðŸŽ‰

So now go, go and run as many migrations as you can in parallel and if it breaks you make sure to blame Prisma. (JK thank you Prisma!)
